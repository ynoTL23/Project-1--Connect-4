# Fall 2018 CMP-326 Project 1 - Connect 4
### Tony Lu

#### Overview
The program simulates the game of Connect 4 where players will take turns placing markers to ultimately win the game. A GUI is created with the help of JFrames so that users can place markers in their desired positions. The game continues until someone wins or a stalemate is presented. Afterwards, they are asked if they want to play another round. The program features a scoreboard that holds each players' wins, losses and number of games.

#### How-To
Connect 4 is a turn-based tabletop game played on a 6x7 grid by 2 players. Each player takes turns placing chips or markers down a column until one player successfully lines up 4 or more of their colored pieces in a row - vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
